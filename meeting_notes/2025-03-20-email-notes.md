The lab the bone samples used for the 2025 research recently published [this paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.4c03115).
This gives insite into the thought process used in the research that will be attempted.

[This](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/massspectrometry/pdfs/Collagen,Remnants,in,Ancient,Bone.pdf) is the dissertation of a researcher that sent the samples that will be used this summer.
The first two chapters give some insite into where the bones came from.

Here are things we need to think about as we analyze these bones:

1. What are our primary goals? What is it that we need to see in order to claim "success"?
2. What steps will it take to get to those primary goals? What are the manageable steps or intermediate goals that we can set for our team?
3. What role(s) does bioinformatics play in helping us achieve those goals? What tools do we need to address the goals from an informatics perspective?
4. How do we "land the plane"? What does it look like for us to bring these pieces together into a workflow that helps us address our primary goals?
